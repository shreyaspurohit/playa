# Share Links & Snapshot Import/Export

## Overview

Two transports move user state between devices and between friends:

- **Share links** — a URL fragment carrying the user's starred camps,
  starred events, home camp, and meet spots. Pasteable, no server
  round-trip.
- **JSON snapshots** — a downloadable file containing all of the
  above PLUS hidden days, imported friends, and the user's own
  nickname. Used for cross-device transfer or sending a richer state
  to a friend.

Both paths use the same banner UX, the same self-vs-friend
recognition, and the same "latest snapshot replaces" semantics.
The sender and receiver must each set a nickname before exporting or
accepting an import. This gives every transferred state an explicit
identity instead of creating anonymous friend records.

## Decisions

- **URL fragment, not query string.** Fragments don't reach the
  server — the data stays client-side end-to-end. GH Pages logs see
  only the path. Fits the "private data" stance of the whole app.
- **Base64url-encoded JSON** in the fragment — `base64` would mangle
  in mail clients (`+`, `/`, `=` all problematic in URLs). The
  fragment is capped at `MAX_ENCODED_LEN` (200 KB) before decode to
  bound DoS.
- **Compact field names** in the share envelope (`n`, `c`, `e`, `m`,
  `s`) — keeps URLs short. Optional fields are omitted when empty so
  byte-equivalent shares from different code paths produce identical
  URLs.
- **Latest-wins for repeats.** Re-importing the same nickname always
  prompts "Replace with latest" or "Ignore" — no merge option. The
  share IS a snapshot of "right now"; merging stale local with new
  remote leaves zombie entries the sender intended to drop.
- **Self-recognition by nickname.** When the incoming share or
  snapshot has the same nickname as the importer's, offer a "Restore
  my own state" branch. Lets the user move their own setup between
  devices via either transport.
- **Nickname required at both ends.** New snapshots always include the
  exporter's nickname, and the nickname cannot be unchecked in the
  export picker. Import actions read the receiver's nickname at click
  time, so setting it in the header takes effect immediately without a
  reload. Legacy anonymous JSON snapshots remain self-restorable after
  the receiver sets a nickname; restore preserves that current nickname.
  Anonymous snapshots cannot be imported as friends.
- **Adversarial input validation.** Both decoders reject:
  - Oversized payloads (size cap before decode).
  - Top-level arrays/primitives (only object envelopes).
  - C0/C1 controls, zero-width chars, bidi overrides in nicknames
    (UI-spoofing attacks).
  - `__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype` as nicknames (object
    pollution).
  - Whole-list reject when over MAX_IDS — drops the attack rather
    than letting MAX_IDS items through.

## Mechanism

### Share link envelope

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  PL["{name, campIds, eventIds,<br>myCampId?, meetSpots?}"] --> Compact["{n,c,e,m?,s?}"]
  Compact --> JSON[JSON.stringify]
  JSON --> Bytes[TextEncoder]
  Bytes --> B64[base64url]
  B64 --> URL["origin + path + #share=…"]
```

### Receiver flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Boot[App boots] --> Read[readShareFromUrl]
  Read --> HasShare{found '#share=…'?}
  HasShare -->|no| Done[no banner]
  HasShare -->|yes| Decode[decodeShare → SharePayload]
  Decode --> Nick{receiver nickname set?}
  Nick -->|no| Nudge[ask user to set header nickname]
  Nick -->|yes| Self{name === ownNickname?}
  Self -->|yes| SelfBanner[ImportBanner: 'this looks like<br>your own share']
  Self -->|no| Existing{friend exists?}
  Existing -->|no| NewBanner[ImportBanner: 'Import as X']
  Existing -->|yes| ConflictBanner[ImportBanner: 'Replace with latest / Ignore']

  SelfBanner -->|Replace my state| Self2[overwrite own LS keys → reload]
  SelfBanner -->|Import as friend instead| Fast2[friends.importFriend overwrite]
  NewBanner -->|Import| Fast3[friends.importFriend overwrite]
  ConflictBanner -->|Replace with latest| Fast4[friends.importFriend overwrite]
```

### Snapshot import via JSON file

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Click[Toolbar 'Import' button] --> Nick{receiver nickname set?}
  Nick -->|no| Nudge[ask user to set header nickname]
  Nick -->|yes| Picker
  Picker -->|user picks file| Parse[parseSnapshot]
  Parse -->|invalid| AlertX[alert and bail]
  Parse -->|valid| State[setIncomingSnapshot]
  State --> Banner[SnapshotImportBanner]
  Banner -->|nickname matches own| Self[applySnapshot full overwrite + reload]
  Banner -->|new friend| Fast[friends.importFriend overwrite]
  Banner -->|existing friend| Conflict[friends.importFriend overwrite latest]
```

### Asymmetry: share vs snapshot

| Field | Share link | Snapshot file |
|---|---|---|
| Nickname | ✓, required | ✓, required for new exports |
| Camp favorites | ✓ | ✓ |
| Event favorites | ✓ | ✓ |
| My camp | ✓ | ✓ |
| Meet spots | ✓ | ✓ |
| Hidden days | ✗ | ✓ |
| Imported friends list | ✗ | ✓ |

Snapshots are richer because they're meant for self-restore (every LS
key recovered). Shares are friend-shaped (URL-friendly, only the
publicly-shareable subset).

## Failure modes & trade-offs

- **Long-URL pain** for huge favorite lists. Empirically: 5000 ids ×
  ~5 chars + base64 overhead ≈ ~40 KB encoded. Fits in every modern
  browser's URL handling.
- **No revocation of a leaked share link**. The data is in the URL;
  once it's out, it's out. Mitigation: shares carry only public-ish
  state (which camps you starred), not credentials.
- **JSON file = on-disk artifact** with the user's full state. They
  should manage these as they would any other personal file.
- **Adversarial nickname ↔ snapshot.friends mismatch**. If a friend's
  snapshot has them named "alice" but I already have an "alice" who
  is a different real person, the latest-wins rule overwrites my
  alice. The "Replace with latest / Ignore" prompt makes this
  explicit, but it's an inherent limitation of nickname-as-key.
